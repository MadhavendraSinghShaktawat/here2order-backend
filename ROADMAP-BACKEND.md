Here2Order Backend Development Roadmap
(Using Express.js + MongoDB + Clerk Auth)

📆 Estimated Completion: 4-6 weeks
📌 Goal: Build a scalable, secure, and high-performance backend

📍 Phase 1: Project Setup & Base Structure (Day 1-3)
✅ Initialize a Node.js + Express.js project
✅ Set up essential dependencies (Express, MongoDB, Clerk, etc.)
✅ Define project folder structure for maintainability
✅ Configure environment variables (.env)
✅ Set up Express server with middleware (CORS, Helmet, Morgan)
✅ Create MongoDB connection

📍 Phase 2: Authentication & Role-Based Access (Day 4-7)
✅ Integrate Clerk Authentication for user management
✅ Implement role-based access control (RBAC) (Owner, Manager, Staff, Customer)
✅ Create a user model and store relevant user data
✅ Implement middleware to protect routes based on roles
✅ Test authentication flow (Sign-up, Sign-in, Role Assignment)

📍 Phase 3: Restaurant & Menu Management (Day 8-12)
✅ Define restaurant model (Owner details, business info, etc.)
✅ Set up menu model (Categories, items, pricing, availability)
✅ Implement CRUD operations for restaurant owners to manage menus
✅ Ensure access control (Only owners can modify their menus)
✅ Optimize data structure for fast menu retrieval

📍 Phase 4: Order Processing & Tracking (Day 13-18)
✅ Define order model (Restaurant ID, Table ID, Items, Status, Timestamp)
✅ Implement order placement API (Customers can place orders)
✅ Build order management API (Staff can update order status)
✅ Set up real-time order updates using Socket.io
✅ Ensure order data is efficiently stored & indexed

📍 Phase 5: Real-Time Notifications & Webhooks (Day 19-22)
✅ Implement real-time updates for order tracking (WebSockets)
✅ Send SMS/WhatsApp notifications to customers (Order status updates)
✅ Configure webhooks for external integrations (If needed)
✅ Handle retry mechanisms for failed notifications

📍 Phase 6: Payments & Billing (Day 23-26)
✅ Integrate Stripe for online payments (Card, UPI, Wallets)
✅ Implement payment tracking (Paid, Pending, Failed)
✅ Link payment history to customer accounts
✅ Ensure secure payment handling with proper validation

📍 Phase 7: Analytics & Reporting (Day 27-29)
✅ Set up sales analytics for restaurant owners (Total revenue, best-selling items)
✅ Implement daily/weekly reports for order insights
✅ Store customer purchase history for future recommendations
✅ Optimize database queries for fast analytics retrieval

📍 Phase 8: Testing, Optimization & Deployment (Day 30-35)
✅ Write unit tests & API tests using Jest/Supertest
✅ Implement error handling & logging for better debugging
✅ Perform load testing to check backend performance
✅ Optimize database indexes for faster queries
✅ Deploy backend on Google Cloud (GCP) / AWS
✅ Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Automate deployments)

🎯 Final Deliverables:
✅ Fully functional, secure, and scalable backend
✅ Real-time order tracking & role-based access
✅ Optimized MongoDB database for fast queries
✅ Secure authentication with Clerk
✅ Seamless payments & notifications integration
✅ Deployed & ready-to-scale infrastructure

This roadmap ensures fast development with minimal mistakes while keeping scalability & security in mind! 🚀
